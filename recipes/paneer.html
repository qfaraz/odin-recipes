    <p> <h2>Description</h2>
        This easy paneer recipe is great for vegetarians. You can add paneer to your favorite curry or dish. Homemade paneer is softer and lighter than the tofu-like consistency of paneer found in many Indian restaurants.

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li> 1 gallon milk</li>
            <li> 1 quart buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup canola oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol><li>Pour milk into a large pot and bring to a boil over medium heat; watch carefully to prevent milk from boiling over. When milk begins to boil, pour buttermilk into the pot in a steady stream, stirring constantly. The milk will separate into curds and water.</li>
        <li>Line a colander with cheesecloth. Pour milk mixture through the cheesecloth, reserving some of the strained liquid. Let milk mixture sit in the colander until curds are settled and dripping stops, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer strained curds to a food processor. Process until smooth and mixture can be formed into a ball. Add some of the reserved liquid and process again if mixture is too dry. The consistency should resemble firm ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>Turn cheese out onto a clean surface and knead until smooth. Form into a ball and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>To cook paneer, heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cut paneer into bite-sized pieces. Fry in hot oil until very pale golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
       </ol>
